#ABOUT
$About This Game\

&LOGO\\

!The Project\
C-evo is a non-commerical game project based on the famous "Sid Meier's
Civilization" by Microprose. The ambition of C-evo is not, to compete with
commercial games for the most exciting presentation. Instead, it aims at being a
true, ageless strategy game that entertains by one thing above all:
challenge. So the project focus is design of rules and AI. For more
information, visit the project homepage:\
::E2 c-evo.org\\

!License\
C-evo is a compilation of work by a number of authors. You are allowed
to play the game and to distribute it without explicit permission. The compilation
itself and all of its components (except for the graphics and the sounds) are in the Public
Domain. Means you can do with it whatever you want. This also includes the binary
code and the sources, which are available from the project homepage. As for
the graphics, you should ask the author of an item before using it for another
purpose than to play.\
::C Credits\\

!Modular AI\
The game has an open AI interface, which means the player can replace the standard AI
contained in the package by other AI algorithms, either for all or for single
nations. C-evo allows playing with up to 8 different AIs in the same
game. The easiest way to develop an AI is to use the C# template. You can find it in the folder where
you installed the game.\
::E1 AI development manual\\

!System Requirements\
-16 bit color depth or better\
-Font smoothing recommended\\

!Command Line Options\
--man ... Show manual only\\

!Uninstall\
Use the Application Wizard from the Control Panel.\\

!Reporting Bugs\

To support the progress of this project, please tell me about problems you have
encountered. But first you should\
-Look to the list of known bugs on the project homepage. Don't
report bugs which are already mentioned there.\
-Look to see if there is already a newer program version than yours. This might
have already fixed your problem, particularly if it's a quite conspicuous one.\
-Read the corresponding manual part. Maybe your bug isn't one. (This game is
not a Civilization II clone!)\
-Be sure it's not a problem with the installation or with some third party
expansion such as alternative AI. If you're not sure, uninstall the game with
the Windows Application Wizard, reinstall it with no expansion and then test
again. In the event of problems with an expansion, please contact its author.\\

Before reporting a problem, please try to find a way to reproduce it. A report
of a reproducable bug is much more valuable. To reproduce the bug it may well
be enough to load the book in the turn before the problem occured and continue
in the same way as before. This is even possible in case of a crash, because
there's always an autosave from the last turn, it's the book with the name
starting on "~".\\

Then, send me a detailed destription of the problem. Use the web form at\
::E3 c-evo.org/_sg/contact\
If your book is
necessary to reproduce the problem, please attach it. You can find the file in
this folder:\

#QUICK
$Quickstart\

!!Quickstart\

Basic hints to get started without studying the concepts:\\

-This is a turn based game. While one nation is doing its turn, all other
nations are inactive (except when contacted for negotiation).\
-Your turns usually end automatically after you have given commands to all units. When
there are no units to order, the game is waiting for you to press "End Turn".
If the game seems to have frozen, this is probably all you have to do.\
-Most items that you can click are marked with a white frame.\
-There can be more than one unit in the same location. You only see the
strongest of them then.\
-If such a group of units is attacked, only the strongest unit of the group
fights the attacker. If that unit is defeated by the attacker, the entire group
of units is destroyed.\
-You can select one of your units by clicking on it. The unit starts to blink
then. The button with the exclamation mark opens a unit command menu, the
commands from which always apply to the selected unit.\
-To move a unit, use the cursor keys or the right mouse button.\
-Click one of your cities to zoom to it. Most important to know about is the
city production project. Click the project display in the middle of the window
and choose a new project, for example new settlers in order to found new cities.\
-How fast your cities produce, how fast they grow and how much they contribute
to money funds and research depends on your management.\
-Shift+Click on an item pops up a help screen about it in many situations.\\

Note that this game has its own rules and concepts. It's not a true remake of
another game. C-evo may remind a lot of the commercial "Civilization" series but it's
different in many regards. This applies to the overall philosophy as well: Don't
expect anything in this game to be CIVILIZED!\


#INTRO
$Introduction\

@@56\
!!Welcome to C-evo\

This game lets you replay the development of the human civilization.
You're leading the nation of your choice through six millenia,
from the first settlement until the colonization of space. Your way is full of
difficulties. Resources are limited, wild areas will take centuries to be
brought under cultivation. Famine and disorder will be a constant threat for
your growing cities.\\

Your foresight is in demand. Expand your empire and improve your cities.
Build barracks, universities and power plants, or even some of the famous
wonders of the world. Discover new technologies and weapons.
Push exploration forward in order to find fertile lands and to complete
your world map. Build ships to discover far continents.\\

Naturally, your nation is not the only one on earth. Nations on every continent
have started to develop their specific culture. Be aware that there's no right
to existence. Every empire might fall, including yours.\\

Your first contact to a
foreign nation might not be pleasant, but diplomacy offers a lot of
possibilities. Buy, sell or exchange all kinds of knowledge. Defend your borders
or protect them by treaties. It's even possibly to form alliances with other
nations. But don't rely too much on your pacts, nations are contestants in
this game! Finally, they are all heading for a goal that only one of them can
achieve: to win.


#BASICS
$Basics\

!!Basics\

Your nation is formed by units and cities. While units are good for
exploration, conquest and defense, cities are the source of growth, production
and research.\\

The world map is divided into quadratical tiles (which appear rhombical but, due to
the perspective). Each tile has a certain terrain type, which defines
its properties: resource production, defense bonus and cost of movement for
units which move onto it. One tile can not contain more than one city, but an
unlimited number of units of one nation. Get help about a tile by clicking on it
while holding the shift key.\
::T Terrain Types\\

The game is turn-based, which means your opponents will not make any moves
until you have completed your turn. By default, your turn ends automatically
after all units have moved. If there are no units to move or if you turned on
"Wait at End of Turn", you must use the "End Turn" button in the right bottom
corner of the screen.\\


#SCIENCE
$Research\

@@46\
!!Research\

A nation can discover several advances. Most of them make special buildings,
unit features, unit designs and/or government forms available. To research a
particular advance, the knowledge of one or two earlier advances (its
prerequisites) might be required.\
::A Advances\\

When the game starts, you will be asked for the first advance to pursue.
Get help about a particular advance in the list by clicking on
it while holding the shift key.
The speed of scientific progress depends on the number of research points (%r)
your nation produces. If enough %r have been collected, the advance
will be discovered, and you can choose the next scientific pursuit.
It's always only one research project at a time, and it's no more possible to
change the subject of research after it was chosen.
The cost for a new advance rises with the number of advances your nation has
discovered.\\

;SCIENCECOST In detail: Cost of research


#SCIENCECOST
$Cost of Research\

!Cost of Research\

The cost for a new advance rises with the number of advances your nation has
discovered. The exact formula for your difficulty level is:\
&TECHFORMULA\\
The number n starts with 4 and increases\
-not when doing military research\
-not when developing Computing Technology\
-by 1 when discovering an advance received from another nation\
-by 2 in all other cases when discovering an advance, including future technologies\
-by 1 when acquiring an advance from the Great Library


#DIPLOMACY
$Diplomacy\

!!Diplomacy\

Two nations do not know about each other before a ground unit of one nation
discovers an adjacent city or ground unit of the other. You can view all information
you have about a foreign nation on the nation report screen. The extent of this
information strongly depends on whether you're having a dossier about
the nation or not. A dossier includes population, territory size, funds,
a list of the nation's discovered advances, its foreign relations and all
charts of the nation's historic development except the military.\\

!Contact\
After two nations know about each other, they can get into contact for
diplomatic negotiation, allowing them to trade or to sign treaties. A
negotiation is a sequence of statements exchanged between the opponents.
However, you can not enter any text. Instead, your statements are automatically
being generated from the options you choose. These options include making
proposals, accepting proposals and canceling treaties.\\

A negotiation ends when the opponents have nothing more to offer each other.
Also, a negotiation can have an unagreed end if one nation breaks it.\\

!Proposals\
Most diplomatic options arise from making and accepting proposals. In general,
a proposal is a combination of items a nation wants to receive from the other
and items it's willing to exchange for them. Possible items are:\
-A treaty\
-Current dossier\
-Military report\
-Money\
-Technology\
-Unit design\
-World map\
-Colony ship parts (when having a space port)\\

If a proposal does not contain wants, it's a present. Just like every
other proposal, a present has to be accepted to become effective. The other way
round, if the proposal only contains wants but no offers, it's a demand.\\

Advances received from a deal with another nation are not immediately
applicable. First your nation has to understand the new technology and to learn
about its application. But this research takes only half of the effort of
developing it yourself, and you don't need prerequisites.\\

!Treaties\
Possible treaties are:\\

-Peace Treaty:
Units of the two nations are not allowed to attack each other or to enter the
other nation's territory. Units have no siege effect on the other nation's cities.\\

-Friendship:
Additionally to the effects of a Peace Treaty, the nations exchange dossiers
each turn.\\

-Alliance:
An Alliance voids all unit movement restrictions caused by state borders or
zones of control for the allied nations. Also, allied nations share all
information (dossier, military, world maps) and they know about each other's unit
movement.\\

A treaty can only be cancelled in a negotiation or when a nation refuses to
receive the other one's emissaries. After cancelling a treaty with a nation,
a nation can't cancel another treaty with this nation within the next 3 turns.
Cancelling a peace treaty with a nation automatically results in cancelling
peace with all nations that it's allied with, even own allies.\\

!Credibility\
You can judge other nations by their credibiliy. The levels are:\
-Respectable (100% credibility)\
-Isolationistic (90% thru 99%)\
-Unpredictable (70% thru 89%)\
-Mendacious (less than 70%)\\

Each turn in peace increases
the credibility of a nation by 1, until the maximum credibility is reached.
Initially, the maximum credibiliy of all nations is 100. Breaking a peace
treaty pushes credibility down by the half and reduces the maximum achievable
by 10. Breaking an alliance pact decreases credibility by a
quarter. The actual credibility of a nation is known to all other nations that
know about this nation, even without direct diplomatic contact.


#SHIP
$Winning the Game\

!!Winning the Game\

There is only one way to win this game: Colonize the stars! Let your nation be
the first to complete a transstellar colony ship, heading for a distant world
suitable for life. A complete colony ship has to be assembled from 12 huge
parts:\\

;:B67 6 Colony Ship Components\
;:B68 4 Power Modules\
;:B69 2 Habitation Modules\\

The production of each of these three types has a high demand for a special
modern resource. Only a city which exploits a tile providing this resource can
produce it. Speeding up the production by utilizing freight, rebuilding
improvements or spending money is not possible. The modern resources are:\
&MODERN\\

A nation does not recognize these resources before the invention of\
::A47 Mass Production


#MOVEMENT
$Moving Units\

!!Moving Units\

Units are the mobile part of your nation. All unit moves and commands you order
apply to the currently selected unit. This one is blinking in the main window,
and also displayed with some extra information at the bottom of the screen
beside the overview map. Move a unit using the cursor resp.
numeric keys or by a right mouse click on the destination tile.\\

!Restrictions\
A unit can always move to an adjacent tile, except for the following
situations:\
-The destination tile is occupied by units of another nation.\
-The unit has not enough movement points left. See below.\
-A ground unit is trying to move onto a sea tile or vice versa.\
-A ship is trying to move to the open sea without navigation capability.\
-A zone of control is violated, see below.\\

!Aircraft\
Aircraft must return to the ground in every turn. An aircraft that is not
located in a city or military base or aboard a carrier in the end of the turn
will be lost. There is, however, a way to escape this restriction to some
degree:\
::F7 the Fuel feature.\\

!Movement Points\
Each move takes "time": it consumes movement points (MP). Ships and
aircraft as well as ground units moving through plain terrain take 1 MP for
moves, which go parallel to the tile grid (e.g. to the North-West)
resp. 1.5 MP for transversal moves (e.g. directly to the North). For ground units in difficult
terrain, these costs increase by 20% resp. 30% of the unit speed more than 1.5 MP.
To move into a mountain area, a ground unit needs its full movement and will
not move the next turn.\
::T Terrain Types\\

Example of MP needed for possible moves:\
@MoveShot\
-Left - A unit with initially 1.5 MP\
-Right - A unit with initially 3 MP\\

If a ground unit moves along a road, river or canal, the costs are 0.4 MP resp.
0.6 MP, no matter of terrain type. If it can take advantage of a railroad
connection, moves cost only 8% resp. 12% of the unit speed.\\
The full MP of a unit, which correspond to the speed of the unit design, are being restored
in the beginning of each turn. Damaged ships do not reach the full speed. Their
MP are reduced proportionally to the damage, but never below 2.5 MP.\\
For longer moves you can use the go-to function. Just right-click on the
destination tile.\\

!Zones of Control\
There are two types of units: such with a Zone of Control (ZoC) and such
without. A ZoC unit can't move between land tiles which are both adjacent to
enemy ZoC units, except one of these tiles is an own city, or the destination tile is
already occupied by an own ZoC unit. Ships, aircraft, and special commandos have no
Zone of Control. Units that are loaded to a transport also don't have a ZoC. Units
without ZoC can't siege tiles.\\

!City Capture\
Ground units with attack power can move into an undefended enemy city. Then
this city has been captured by your nation and is now one of yours. Enemy units which
had their home in the captured city are being destroyed. The size of the
city reduces by 1, which leads to the city's destruction if it falls below the minimum city
size of 2 then. A captured city remains in disorder for three turns.


#COMMANDS
$Unit Commands\

@@16\
!!Unit Commands\

The command menu offers several commands for the currently selected unit,
depending on its design and location:\

-Disband: Disband unit\
-Integrate: Integrate unit into the new unit currently produced by the city it's located in\
-Go On: Continue movement to previously given destination\
-Wait: Select next unit\
-No Orders: No orders and no more automatic selection for this turn\
-Stay Here: No orders and no more automatic selection\
-Recover: No orders and no more automatic selection until the unit has recovered to 100% health\
-Support From Here: Make the city which the unit is located in its home\
-Return to Nearest City: Move unit to any own city as fast as possible\
-Center: Center main window to unit location\
-Pillage: Destroy terrain improvement (Pillaging costs 1 MP and destroys one
improvement at a time.)


#SETTLE
$Colonization\

@@29\
!!Colonization\

Settlers and engineers can build terrain improvements, which improve the
properties of that tile:\

-Settle Down: the settlers start building a new city\
-Build ...: build terrain improvement, see below\
-Clear Forest: change forest tile to prairie\
-Drain Swamp: change swamp tile to grassland\
-Afforest\
-Transform: transform terrain type, see terrain types for transformation
effects\
-Clean up Pollution\\

Building a terrain improvement takes a certain number
of movement points. These MP can be collected over several turns, and more than
one working unit can contribute. However, a unit needs 1 MP left in the
current turn in order to start a job. Engineers MP do not have more effect than
Settlers MP, but Engineers have more of them, that's why they work faster.\
::J Terrain Improvements\
::T Terrain Types


#COMBAT
$Combat\

!!Combat\

You can attack an enemy unit on an adjacent tile using keyboard or mouse,
exactly as you'd move onto that tile. But not every attack is allowed.
Normally, you can't attack a sea unit with a ground unit or vice versa. Ships
can not attack from inside cities and from canals. Aircraft may only be
attacked by other aircraft, except they're located in a city or military base.
The weaker unit will be destroyed in the battle, the stronger will be damaged -
the more superiority, the less damage. You can get an exact forecast of an
attack by right-clicking on the target while holding the shift key.\\

A unit's basic combat strength differs between attack and defense. The two
values are usually noted together with a slash, e.g. a 75/25 unit design has a
basic attack strength of 75 and a basic defense strength of 25. In a particular
combat, these values are modified by several factors:\
-Experience. Each level increases the strength of a unit by 25%. See below.\
-Terrain bonus for ground units (defender only). See terrain type list.\
-Special facilities (defender only), e.g. city wall or fortress.\
-Fortification (defender only). A ground unit that is not loaded to a transport
and didn't move in the previous
turn has fortified and thus gets an additional 50% strength bonus.\
-Aircraft in cities or bases have no defense strength, ships have their
strength in cities and on canals reduced to half.\
Note that these bonus values have accumulative effect, not multiplicative.\\

If the attacking unit has less than 1 MP left, it doesn't have enough time
for a well-organized attack. Its strength is reduced proportionally in that
case.\\

!Attacking a Group of Units\
If two or more units are located at the same tile and being attacked, only one of
them is going to defend the position. This is always the unit which was visible
to the attacker before he attacked. Usually, the defender is the strongest unit
present.\\

;TILEDEF In detail: Tile defender\\

If the defending unit is defeated and not located in a city, fortress
or military base, all units on the same tile will be destroyed - even
submarines and stealth aircraft.\\

!Experience\
The experience of a unit increases with the damage it receives in combat: 100%
make one experience level. The experience levels are:\
&EXPERIENCE\\

!Recovery\
A damaged unit regenerates proportionally to its movement points left at the
end of a turn. If it has not moved within this turn, its health increases by
8 resp. by 20 if it's located in a city or military base, provided the city is
not in disorder. However, the health
of the unit can not increase by more than a factor of 2 per turn. Units do not
recover on water. Airplanes only recover in cities and military bases.\\

!Bombardment\
Ships and aircraft with attack power can bombard adjacent undefended enemy
cities, provided the unit has at least 1 MP left. The population of the
bombarded city decreases by 1, as long as this would not lead to its complete
destruction. The unit does not take damage and not gain experience. Order
bombardment using mouse or keyboard in the same way as an attack.\\

!Expelling Units\
A nation can expel units of nations that it has a peace treaty with from its
territory using an own unit. This must be a ground or naval unit with at least
1 MP left, which would be able to attack the foreign unit if there was no
treaty. Order this action using mouse or keyboard in the same way as an attack.


#TILEDEF
$Tile Defender\

!Tile Defender\

A group of units, when attacked, is usually defended by the strongest of these
units. But under certain conditions not. The exact scheme for choosing the tile
defender is as follows:\
-The supreme criterion considers the categories of the units. First choice are
fanatic ground units, second are normal units with zone of control,
third are normal units with no zone of control, fourth are submarines and
stealth aircraft. Units loaded to a transport ship or plane never defend.\
-If two or more units are in the highest category, the one with the best
defense strength will do the job. The strength calculation considers
experience, health and fortification. Not being considered are special features
which are only effective against special enemies.\
-If two or more units have the same highest defense power (not very likely),
the one with the least production cost will defend.


#SPYMISSIONS
$Covert Operations\

@@28\
!!Covert Operations\

Only special commandos are able to perform covert operations. You can order such an operation by
moving a commando into a foreign city. Choose from five mission types:\
-Sabotage production: City production will be paralysed next turn.\
-Steal maps.\
-Collect third nation knowledge: You acquire any knowledge this nation
has about third nations.\
-Prepare dossier. Call the nation screen, the research report and the charts for the details. \
-Prepare military report.\\

A peace treaty between two nations forbids operations against each other. However,
special commandos are able to infiltrate any territory, with no respect to treaties.


#CLASSES
$Unit Designs\

!!Unit Designs\

Your nation can only produce units of known design. Warriors
and Settlers are known right from the start, some special units become
available with a certain advance or wonder.\
::S Special Units\\

All other unit designs you wish to produce must be developed by your
scientists. After you have the needed base knowledge (e.g. Warrior Code for
introducing new ground units), you can choose "Military Research" from the
research selection, which brings you to the Military Research screen:\\

@DraftShot\

Legend:\
-1: Weight\
-2: Current modifiers\
-3: Select features and capacities here\
-4: Domain selection\
-5: Properties of the new unit\\

The properties of a unit design depend on two things: Firstly, on what
technologies are available when you research it. Some scientific advances cause
an upgrade in one or more weaponry branches, increasing the appropriate
strength modifier - and the cost modifier, too. There are also transport
modifiers, influencing the number of units a transport unit can carry.\\

Secondly, the new unit design depends on what capacities and special features
you select for it. Increase resp. decrease single features by clicking the
small buttons on the left. Most of the features increase cost (%p) and weight
(%w) of your unit. The maximum weight depends on the weapon branch and the
technologies you have discovered. Get help on a particular feature by clicking
on it while holding the shift key.\
::F Unit Features\\

In the end, attack strength, defense strength and transport capacity of the
unit design are calculated with base value × modifier. If you play on the lower
resp. higher difficulty level, the costs of a unit decrease resp.
increase by 25%.


#CITIES
$City Management\

@@43\
!!City Management\

The main function of a city is to collect resources from the surrounding area
and to process them. Your nation starts with a single city, your capital. There
are two ways to get addional cities: settle down a settler in order to found a
new city, or capture an enemy city. Founding cities is only possible in terrain
that allows irrigation (Grassland, Plains, Prairie, Hills, Tundra).\\

Each city has its own management screen, which pops up when you click on it: \\

@CityShot\

The parts of this screen are described within the following sections.\\

!Citizens\

The population of a city is managed in large groups, each represented by one
face on the screen. The size of the city, counted in groups, is shown in the
top left corner of the city screen. The minimum size of a city is 2. Any event
which would reduce the size to less than 2 means disbandment of this city. The
maximum city size is 8 but can be increased with special city improvements.\\

Each group can exploit one tile in the city area (1) to collect the resources
of this tile. A tile can't be exploited by more than one group. Tiles which are
already exploited by another city (own or foreign) are marked as unavailable.\\

Groups which do not exploit a tile remain in the civil service as police units
(2) - more about that in the next section.\\

!Happiness\

The top right panel on the city screen (3) shows the happiness status of the
city. Three items are important for this section:\

-Wealth (symbol: %l). It's generated from trade, if wealth is turned on in the
"Economy and Tax" settings. See section "Trade" below.\
-Morale (%m). A city always starts with 4 basic morale points, indicated on the
city tile. The value can be increased by certain city improvements.
Additionally, the wonders of the world increase morale in the city they're
built in by 2%m each.\
-Control (%o). This results from maintaining police units. Each group of citizens
in civil service increases control by 2%o. The special unit Town Guard also
allows to control the population.\\

Morale and wealth increase the happiness of the population. It's fundamental
for the city's function that each group of citizens is either happy
or under control. So the sum of happiness (morale and wealth) and control must
not fall below the population number. If it does, civil disorder is the consequence.\\

Under some government forms, unrest lowers the happiness of the population in
certain situations. For more, see\
::G Government forms\\

!Faith\
Under fundamentalism, the happiness calculation is different. Every group of
inhabitants produces one point of faith which is enough to make this group
happy. So the happiness status of a city under fundamentalism doesn't require
any attention, because there is no chance of disorder. Morale and control
are irrelevant.\\


!Resources\

Tiles make their resources once per turn. There are three basic resource types
collected in the city area: food (%f), material (%p) and trade (%t).
These three resource types are processed in different ways, described in the next
three sections.\\

The output of a single tile depends on:\
::T Terrain type\
::J Terrain improvements\
::G Government form\\

!Food\
The food resource (%f) represents all kind of food. The processing of this
resource is shown on the food panel (4). It is necessary to supply the city
population, since each group of citizens consumes 2%f per turn. There are also some unit types that
take food support from their home city. Lacking food will be taken from the food
storage of the city. If the storage is empty, the city will be stricken with
famine: one group of citizens resp. one unit relying on food support will die. But usually,
the city produces more food than necessary.
If so, the surplus goes to the food storage. Exception: big cities (size 8 and
bigger) with only a single surplus resource; they convert it to money.
Whenever the storage is full and the city has not yet reached the maximum size,
the city grows, i.e. it's getting one additional group of citizens.\\

!Material\
Material (%p) is an abstract resource type that stands for anything usable
for production: wood, ore, oil etc. The processing of this
resource is shown on the material panel (5). Some of the material is required to support
units which have their home in the city. The rest of the material is being
accumulated for production. You can change the project of the city (6) by
clicking on it. The city map (7) shows the current improvement state of the
city. Find more about production in the chapter "Production".\\

!Trade\
This resource type (symbol: %t) stands for resources having a value for trading.
Trade is
only produced by tiles in the city area, not by the tile in which the
city itself is located - even not if this is a tile with a gold resource.
The processing of trade is shown on the trade panel (8). Some of the
trade income is lost due to corruption, which depends on the government
form and increases with the distance between a city and your nation's
capital. The rest of the %t is first being taxed according to the current tax
rate, as adjusted in the "Economy and Tax" settings. What remains is split into
research and wealth, as set in "Economy and Tax". Taxes (%c) go to the money
funds, research points (%r) go to the current research project of your nation.
Wealth (%l) increases the happiness of the city population. Note that
collecting trade requires at least a\
::B49 Town Hall.\\

;CORRUPTION In detail: Corruption calculation\\

!Siege\
A city can't exploit a tile on which a unit of a foreign nation is located, except the
two nations are at peace. So enemy units are able to siege your cities by blocking
access to food, material, and trade resources. Of course you can siege enemy cities
as well. If the area of your city is overlapping an enemy city area, siege allows
you to stop the enemy city from exploiting a tile, so your city is able to exploit that
tile the next turn.\\

!Automatic Population Management\
The allocation of the groups of city inhabitants to tiles in the city area and
to civil service happens automatically and optimally. You only need to set
the priorities for the optimization with the primacy selector (9). There are 5
positions:\
-Maximize Growth (default setting). Maximize the city growth with no
compromize. Any number of other resources is sacrificed for a gain of a a
single food point.\
-Maximize Production. Maximize the production with no compromize, although tax
is still considered useful for rushing projects. But any amount of food and
research is sacrificed for a gain of a a single material point.\
-Maximize Research. Maximize the trade-related output of the city (research and
tax) with little compromize. Food is considered almost worthless.\
-Hurry Production. A compromise between growth and other aims, where production
takes precedence over research and tax income.\
-Hurry Research. A compromise between growth and other aims, where research and
tax income take precedence over production. Trade Goods are
considered tax, not production for the evaluation.\\

;OPTI In detail: The formulas\\

Note that, under some circumstances, certain settings can't match their name
because what they are targeting at doesn't exist. Examples: "Max Production"
when city produces Trade Goods, "Max Growth" when
city can't grow, "Max Research" when city doesn't have a Town Hall. The
settings still work in these cases, but only with their second priorities,
which might lead to unexpected results.\\

Superior to the selectable primacy, the optimization always considers three
criteria that you can't change:\
-1st priority: Civil order is maintained\
-2nd priority: Unit material support is granted\
-3rd priority: Food supply for population and supported units is granted\\

!Full Control\
If you don't want to use the automatic population management for some reason,
you can turn it off by clicking the primacy selector at the bottom segment or
by clicking in the city area. This allows you to freely choose which tiles to
exploit. Click an exploited tile to send the group which is allocated to it
to civil service. Click a non-exploited tile to exploit it with a group which
is in civil service currently. (The latter, of course, only works if there is
such group.) This way, you can move a group from one tile to another in two
steps.\\

When the automatic management is turned off, you have to care for everything
alone: food supply, unit support, civil disorder. You might come across
problems that you never had before.\\

!Civil Disorder\
Whenever a city can't control its unhappy population (as described in the
section "Happiness" above), it will fall to disorder and stop production,
research and tax collection. In the second successive turn of disorder, the
city will also stop unit support, so it will lose one of the units requiring
support in each turn until the order is restored.\\

The automatic population management usually prevents civil disorder. The only
situation in which this doesn't work is when there's too much unrest. So, if
you experience disorder in a managed city, reduce unrest by moving the units
that cause the unrest to a position where they don't, or disband them.\\

If you turned the automatic management off, it's on you to get the happiness
balance of the city right. The most frequent response to impending disorder is
to expand the police.


#CORRUPTION
$Corruption Calculation\

!Corruption Calculation\

The exact corruption of a city is calculated using this formula:\
@CORRUPTION\
-T - Trade produced by the city\
-C - Corruption factor of the government form\
-D - Distance between the city and the capital\
-Dmax - Maximum theoretical distance between two cities (the whole map height
and the half map width away from each other)\\

If a nation has no capital, corruption is 50% in all cities with a courthouse
and 100% in all other cities, no matter which government form.


#OPTI
$City Optimization Formulas\

!City Optimization Formulas\

Mathematically, the five primacy settings of the automatic population
management only differ in the value m that is
being maximized. The calculation of m considers food (f), production (p),
tax (t) and research (r) after all amplifying effects:\
-Maximize Growth: m = f, m2 = 2p + t + r\
-Maximize Production: m = 4p + t, m2 = r, m3 = f\
-Maximize Research: m = 2r + t + p, m2 = f\
-Hurry Production: m = sqrt(f) * (8p + 2t + r)\
-Hurry Research: m = sqrt(f) * (r + t + p)


#PRODUCTION
$Production\

!!Production\

After founding or capturing a city, its project is set to "Trade Goods",
means the collected material is being converted to money. You can select another
project by clicking on the project picture. The choice depends on the current
knowledge level of your nation. Get help about a particular project in the list
by clicking on it while holding the shift key. Choose from three categories of
projects:\
-Units\
-City and state improvements\
-Wonders\\

If you change a city's project to another project of the same category, you
will lose 1/3 of the collected material. If you change to a different category,
the collected material will be sold. To
speed up the production of a city or state improvement, you can
rebuild an existing building for it, which redeems 2/3 of the production
material of that building. To speed up the production of a unit (except for
freight units), you can integrate a unit located in this city. This redeems 2/3
of the production material of that unit, provided its health is 100% or
reduced proportionally, if not.\\

!Emigration\
Settlers, Engineers, Slaves and Conscripts are formed from city population,
thus the size of a city reduces when it produces a unit of these kinds. The
production of Conscripts and Slaves means an emigration of one group of citizens,
Settlers and Engineers take two groups. Emigration is reversible: These units
can be added to a city, provided it has not reached the maximum size. That
makes the population of that city grow by 1 resp. 2 groups.\\

!Conscription\
You can produce any ground unit as conscripts. The unit emigrates from the
city then, and additionally it needs 1%f food support. The production costs of the unit
decrease by 3 times its cost multiplier, but not below the single multiplier.
Calling up conscripts requires the
knowledge of\
::A18 Conscription\\

!Buying and Selling Projects\
You can speed up a production so that the project is complete the turn after.
This costs fourfold the amount in money as %p are outstanding. The other way
round, you can sell a project by changing it to "Trade Goods". The collected
resources are converted to money then.\\

!Pollution\
Each exploited material resource causes one pollution point. Each group of citizens
tolerates one pollution point, more pollution accumulates. If the accumulated
pollution of a city exceeds 240, a tile in the city radius will be polluted,
thus losing half of its resource output. Pollution can be cleaned up with
settlers and engineers.


#BUILDINGS
$Buildings\

@@67\
!!Buildings\

Each building has a special positive effect on the city it's built in, or on
your whole nation. There are three types of buildings, which differ in how
often they are allowed to be built:\
-City Improvements: Can be built once in each city.\
-State Improvements: Can only exist once in your nation. If a city builds a
state improvement that already existed in another one of your cities, the older
building is being sold.\
-Wonders: Can be built only once on earth. If a nation has built a wonder, the
other nations can't produce this one anymore. If a wonder has been destroyed
(because its city was destroyed), it's lost for all time.\\

::B City Improvements\
::B201 State Improvements\
::B202 Wonders\\

Most city and state improvements cause maintenance costs, which are
taken from your nation's money funds. If the funds are too low, a random
building is being sold.\\

Click the button "Show Improvements" in the city screen to see the improvements
built in the city. If you wish to sell or rebuild one of them, click on its
picture. The proceeds of an improvement sale are equal to its production cost
and go to the money funds.


#SUPPORT
$Unit Support\

!!Unit Support\

Each unit needs to be supported by its home city with one %p each
turn. Ships with a weight of 6%w or more take double support.
Initially, the home city of a unit is the city it was produced in. If you
want to change the home city, move the unit to the desired city and choose the
"Support From Here" command. Click the button "Show Support" in the city screen to
see the units supported by the city.\\

A small number of free units do not need support, indicated by a grayed (%n) instead
of the normal support symbol (%p). This number depends on the government form. If the
city does not produce enough material to support all of its units, one
unit will be lost. This is usually the least worthy.\\

If a city remains in disorder for more than one turn, it stops unit support; so
if there are units to support by this city, one of them is lost in each turn.


#MACRO
$Macro Management\

!!Macro Management\

Playing this game should be fun, not a job. Macro management helps you to get
rid of repetitive tasks, so that you can concentrate on strategy. Macro
management does not allow to do things that you couldn't do without, but it
allows to play in a more efficient way. However, it is not recommendable to
make use of macro management before you have understood the basics of what you
want to have managed.\\

!Terrain Enhancement\
This allows to define a fixed order of terrain improvements for each terrain
type. After you have defined a terrain enhancement, you can apply it with the
Settler command "Enhance" - the Settler will build the chosen terrain
improvements in the order defined. With a three-button mouse, you can even
combine this with the go-to function, just click with the middle mouse button
onto the tile to improve, and the Settler will automatically move there and
work.\\

!City Types\
You can define improvement queues for four types of cities. Use drag&drop to
arrange the building order. In order to switch a city to the building queue,
choose the desired city type as its project. Changes in the city type building
order will automatically apply to all cities. However, the current building
project of a cities is never being abandoned. The city type will keep chosen
even after all improvements are complete.


#START
$Using the Start Screen\

!Starting a Game\

The start screen has three pages, switch them with the tabs at the top. To
start a new game, go to the page "New Book". Choose the number of foreign nations
there and your difficulty level. If you have alternative AIs
installed, you can pick one of them instead of the standard AI by clicking the
AI box. To start playing, press "Start".\\

!Free Player Setup\
When you check the box "Free Player Setup", you have much more freedom in defining
competitors and difficulty levels. Only this mode allows to play multiplayer
games in hotseat mode, to play against different AIs
at the same time or to start AI-only games in supervisor or in tournament mode.
Use the nine boxes to select how many human players and how many AI
controlled nations are going to take part in the game. Just click the boxes and
pick the competitor from a list. The left three boxes have an additional switch
labelled "3", making these boxes a selection for 3 nations at once, so that you
can compete against up to 14 nations in total.\\

Every competitor has its own difficulty level, you can adjust it at the left
side of the box. One bar stands for the easiest level, three bars are the
hardest one. For example, if you play against AI and wish to
have your game as hard as possible, put your own difficulty (i.e. that of the
Local Player) to the highest and all the difficulties for AI nations to the lowest.\\

A higher difficulty results in slower population growth, slower production and
slower research, since the city food storage size as well as the production
and research costs are increased.\\

!Loading a Game\

When you break a game and decide to save the book, it will apear in the list of
old books. Select it and press "Open" to continue with playing. A book contains
all turns of a game. If you'd like to open the game at another point than its
end, use the textbox to specify the year before you open the book.\\

!Maps\

By default, you play on a random world map that is automatically
generated at the beginning of the game. On the "Maps" page, you can adjust two
parameters of this world: its size and the percentage of land.\\

Alternatively, it is possible to play on a special map that someone has
designed for C-evo, e.g. a map of the real earth. The package does not
contain maps, but there are several ones available from the project homepage.
Move map files to the subfolder "Maps".
You only need the map to start a game. The map is not necessary to open the
book later, because the map is being saved within it.


#MAPEDIT
$Map Editor\

!!Map Editor\

There is a simple editor for maps contained in the game. To run it, switch to
the page "Maps" on the start screen. Select the map you wish to edit and press
the "Editor" button. If you'd like to create a new map, choose "Random Map",
adjust size and land mass of the desired map, then start the editor.\\

The operation of the editor is very simple. Pick a terrain type or object
from the list at the bottom of the screen, then paint it to the map using the
mouse. The differentiation between ocean/coast and normal tiles/special
resources happens automatically, you have no influence on that. Don't forget
to add at least one deposit of each modern resource, otherwise it will be
impossible for the players to complete the transstellar colony ship.\\

It's important to define nation starting positions. A map cannot be played by
more nations than there are starting positions on the map. If no starting positions
are defined, this map is not playable. If you'd like to have the human player
start at a certain one of the positions, define it as preferred.\\

Maps are not shown to the player on the start screen. Instead, you can make a
theme picture for a map. This must be a BMP file with the same name as the
map. Just put it to the maps folder. The maximum size of the picture is 192×96
pixels.


#AIT
$AI Tournament\

!!AI Tournament\

If you have different AIs installed, you can let them compete against each
other in a tournament. Switch to "Free Player Setup" on the start screen and
choose "AI Tournament" in the middle box, then
press "Start". This will make the game reduce itself to a small dialog.
After pressing the play button, C-evo will start to play an endless series of
complete games (rounds). The result are simple statistics, which are updated
after each round:\\

@AITShot\

The numbers stand for:\
