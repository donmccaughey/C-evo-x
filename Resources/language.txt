#NOALTAI No other AIs installed.\Download alternative AI modules from the C-evo homepage or build your own.
#REVOLUTION Are we going to leave the #a empire to anarchy so that we can establish a new form of administration after the chaos is overcome?
#AUTOREVOLUTION There is a new government form open to us:\%s\\In order to
change to this form of administration, we'd have to depose the present
government and get over a period of anarchy. Start the Revolution?
#NOALTGOVS A revolution will let us change the form of our government. Currently, this doesn't make sense because we have not learned yet about other government forms than despotism.
#AGE1 = %s =\Our ancestor's knowledge is incomplete and flawed. Many questions can't be
answered correctly from the library. We parted with dogmatism, and we will evolve our view
of the world by precisely observing things. We call it science.
#AGE2 = %s =\After the achievement of mass production, for the first time in
history wealth is no more the privilege of a minority. The consequences reach
far. The mass market allows investments of a previously unknown dimension,
leading into a new technological era.
#AGE3 = %s =\An old human dream might turn to reality. We have now the
technology to start the colonization of remote solar systems. Studies indicate
that special metals will be the key to this gigantic project.
#ENDTURN No units waiting for commands this turn.\End turn to continue with no action.
#CREDUP Our credibility has risen to "%s".
#CREDDOWN Our credibility has fallen to "%s".
#CAPTURE #N are capturing the city of %s!
#BOMBARD #N are bombarding the unprotected city of %s!
#EXPEL Units have been expelled from #a territory.
#DISPOSE %s\\Shall we rebuild this building?
#SPDESTRUCTQUERY \(Note: We will lose control of our colony ship when we dismantle the space port!) 
#SELL %s\\Shall we sell this building?
#LOSEMAT A complete change in project type means to start a new project. %d%%p will be sold for %d%%c.
#LOSEMAT3 Changing the project will result in a loss of 1/3 of the material collected for the project. Continue?
#DOUBLESTATEIMP %s\\This state improvement already exists in the city of %s. Shall we move it to this city and sell the former building when finished? 
#READY The project will be completed next turn.
#NOMONEY We don't have enough money\to complete this project next turn.\(%d%%c needed, %d%%c available)
#BUY Should we spend %d%%c to complete this project next turn?
#EMIGRATE Emigration may cause the city's collapse. Shall we delay the completion of this unit until the city has enough population to subsist?
#ADDTOMAXSIZE This city has reached its maximum size.
#CITYMANAGEOFF Turn off automatic population management?
#GLIDERLOST Our glider was lost at sea.
#PLANELOST Our aircraft has run out of fuel.
#DAMAGED_UTILIZE Utilizing a damaged unit has reduced benefit. Continue?  
#NOBB We lack the technology of building bridges across rivers.
#NOCITY This type of terrain is not suitable for settlement. We should look for terrain that allows irrigation.
#NOCAPTURER Civil units can not capture cities.
#NOBOMBARDER Bombarding cities requires attack power.
#ZOC This type of unit can not move within zones under foreign control.
#FASTATTACK Attack with %d%% power?
#NOTIMELOADGROUND This type of unit requires %s movement points to be loaded onto a transport or unloaded from one.
#NOTIMELOADAIR An aircraft requires 100 movement points to be loaded onto a carrier or unloaded from one.
#NOTIMEBOMBARD Bombarding a city requires 100 movement points.
#NOTIMEEXPEL Expelling a unit requires 100 movement points.
#NOROAD This unit can only move along roads and railroads.
#NONAV This ship has no navigation capability.
#NOTRANSPORT This ship has no transport capability.
#FULLTRANSPORT This transport is fully loaded.
#LOWFUEL This aircraft is now low on fuel. If it moves farther, it won't be able to return to a city or military base. Continue?
#LOWFUEL_GLIDER This unit needs to return to the ground in the end of the turn. If it moves farther, it will be lost. Continue?
#UNREST_FOREIGN %s\\This is #a territory. Moving there will increase unrest in the unit's home city. Continue anyway?
#UNREST_NOTOWN %s\\Leaving #s will increase unrest in the unit's home city. Continue anyway?
